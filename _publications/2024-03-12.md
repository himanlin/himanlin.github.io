title: "Health communication on social media at the early stage of the pandemic: Examining health professionals’ COVID-19 related tweets"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2024-03-12
excerpt: 'Focusing on health professionals’ tweets regarding COVID-19, this study examines whether and how those tweets are unique based on their identity as health experts. The data revealed that the infusion of health communication with political opinions, whether pro- or against certain political parties or health policies, reflects values and may deviate from the original purpose of health communication. In addition, sentiment analysis countered the intuitive thought that health experts merely fulfill their role as neutral encyclopedias without excessively carrying sentiment. We conclude by reflecting on the meaning of health communication in relation to the political stances of professionals.'

I collaborated on this research project with Dr. Yao-Tai Li and Dr. Hsuan-Wei Lee. This study focused on the unique communication patterns of health professionals on social media platforms, which are mostly based in the United States, particularly in the context of the pandemic outbreak in the first half of 2020. In this research, I employed empirical quantitative research methodologies, encompassing time series analysis, natural language processing, and social network analysis, to analyze the public conversation that was embedded in the subsequent relationship, changing across the time period. We fill the gap in the literature that mainly discusses how national and international health agencies take actions during pandemics. We use a mixed-methods approach to provide a more systematic understanding of the information shared by health professionals that aligns with their personal political attitudes.
