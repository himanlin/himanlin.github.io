I am an incoming Sociology PhD student at University of Washington. I am interested in social networks and computational social science. I aspire to investigate how social relationships influence inequality, particularly in individuals' early lives; additionally, I aim to explore the interaction between social media and human behavior. I am keen to explore the dynamic social network with diverse quantitative methodologies. I received my B.A. in Economics at National Taiwan University in June 2023. Besides, I was an exchange student at Lund University, Sweden, in 2022â€“2023. Currently, I am supervised by Dr. Hsuan-Wei Lee in the Institute of Sociology at Academia Sinica, Taiwan.
