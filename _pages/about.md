I am an incoming Sociology PhD student at University of Washington. I am interested in social networks and computational social science. I received my B.A. in Economics at National Taiwan University in June 2023. Besides, I was an exchange student at Lund University, Sweden, in 2022â€“2023.

Currently, I am supervised by Dr. Hsuan-Wei Lee in the Institute of Sociology at Academia Sinica, Taiwan.
